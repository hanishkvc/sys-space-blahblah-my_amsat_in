Idea for STEM + Shakti/Vega + Space To encourage Students at heart

Hi,

To encourage and kindle interest in students (including those at heart) to explore multiple domains while still having some fun, with support from ISRO, IIT/CDAC and HAMs, some should look at building 

A FM AMSATs (Pico/Nano/...) with

a) Polar Sun Synchronous orbit - so that its relatively easier from tracking the satellite perspective as well as potentially in perpetual sun light (provided temperatures can be handled).

b) Operating in Mode J (V/U) OR should it be Mode B (U/V) so that someone just receiving doesnt have to worry about adjusting freq for doppler shifts much (at the lower 145 MHz)

c) A FM repeater

d) Two Processing paths

d.1) Normal Shakti SOC and

d.2) Shakti-F or Equivalent potentially Resilient RISC-V SOC on a Radiation Hardened FPGA

Both of Which once every 24 hours resets a counter to 0 and then keep incrementing once every 2 minutes or so. (Maybe if required in that 2 minute do a series of Add/Sub/Mult/Div operations such that the end result wrt increment value is 1).

Maybe alternate between the FM repeater and a Simple Frequency tone coded data digits (0-9, each digit having a freq 200Hz appart from the next) mode every other day.

During the Simple Frequency tone coded Data Digits mode keep sending the following in a loop over the FM downlink.

8 Digit-0s
Normal SOC Counter Value 3 Digits
Hardened FPGA SOC Counter Value 3 Digits
8 Digit-9s
3 Digit Temp Readout
3 Digit light intensity readout

If the orbit and batteries help ensure moving between day side and night side, then maybe more interesting readings wrt Temp and Light intensity can be got.

During FM Repeater Mode, repeat the uplink in downlink or if no uplink then switch to simple frequency tone data mode.

The above at one end should help test out the SOCs in a interesting setup, while also providing a interesting interaction oppurtunities to students at heart.

ALERT: I have never designed a satellite in life, so do forgive if there are stupidities. But something along the above (with suitable adjustments) I feel would be interesting and challenging in a good way.
